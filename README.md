# Gopher Interface Devices (USB HID)

The `hid` package is a cross platform library for accessing and communicating with USB Human Interface
Devices (HID). It is an alternative package to [`gousb`](https://github.com/karalabe/gousb) for use
cases where devices support this ligher mode of operation (e.g. input devices, hardware crypto wallets).

The package wraps [`hidapi`](https://github.com/libusb/hidapi) for accessing OS specific USB HID APIs
directly instead of using low level USB constructs, which might have permission issues on some platforms.
The `hidapi` dependency is vendored directly into the repository and wrapped using CGO, making the `hid` package self-contained
and go-gettable.

Supported platforms at the moment are Linux, macOS and Windows (exclude constraints are also specified
for Android and iOS to allow smoother vendoring into cross platform projects).

## Dependencies 

On linux, the 'libudev' package is required for building. 

On Ubuntu:

	apt install libhidapi-dev


On Fedora:

	dnf install systemd-devel


## Cross-compiling

Using `go get` the embedded C library is compiled into the binary format of your host OS. Cross compiling to a different platform or architecture entails disabling CGO by default in Go, causing device enumeration `hid.Enumerate()` to yield no results.

To cross compile a functional version of this library, you'll need to enable CGO during cross compilation via `CGO_ENABLED=1` and you'll need to install and set a cross compilation enabled C toolkit via `CC=your-cross-gcc`.

## Acknowledgements

Although the `hid` package is an implementation from scratch, it was heavily inspired by the existing
[`go.hid`](https://github.com/GeertJohan/go.hid) library, which seems abandoned since 2015; is incompatible
with Go 1.6+; and has various external dependencies. Given its inspirational roots, I thought it important
to give credit to the author of said package too.

Wide character support in the `hid` package is done via the [`gowchar`](https://github.com/orofarne/gowchar)
library, unmaintained since 2013; non buildable with a modern Go release and failing `go vet` checks. As
such, `gowchar` was also vendored in inline (copyright headers and origins preserved).
